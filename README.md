As a prospective Data Engineer, I wish to use this project to exhibit the
knowledge I have acquired over the past few months of studying. The main goal of the project is to build infrastructure on AWS with the use of code. Also, I will show how to seemlessly move data from one to another wthin this infrastructure, query and also do some transformations.
